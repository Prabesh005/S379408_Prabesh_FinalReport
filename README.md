This project is all about crafting a responsive profile card component that showcases professional details like a profile image, name, job title, skills, and social media links. Itâ€™s built using semantic HTML, CSS (with Flexbox, CSS variables, and smooth transitions), and good old vanilla JavaScript. The card is designed to be fully accessible, mobile-friendly, and super easy to customize. With its clean layout and gentle animations, it presents information in a clear way while achieving top-notch Lighthouse accessibility scores, making it a perfect template for portfolios or team websites.


Hypotheses


Design Impact: By using a circular profile image and a gradient header, we expect to boost user engagement by 20% compared to traditional flat rectangular designs, as shown by click-through rates.

Accessibility: Implementing proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML should help us achieve a perfect 100% Lighthouse accessibility score, while also cutting down screen reader navigation time by 30%.

Performance: With lazy-loaded images and optimized CSS, we aim to keep page load times under 1 second even on 3G connections, as confirmed by Lighthouse audits.
